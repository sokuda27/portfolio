            My final project consisted of two parts. The first part was to analyze a dataset on aircraft incidents using the techniques taught in the class. 
            After determining what features had strong correlations, I used a combination of regression and classifciation algorithms to determing how fatal a particular incident was, given certain parameters. 
            The figure below is a linear regression I attempted to fit to the data.

            The second half of the final was to choose our own dataset. My partner and I decided to analyze Disney movies; we attempted to predict box office revenue from parameters like IMDB rating and budget. 
            These chosen features were selected in a similar manner to part 1, using correlation plots. 
            We also used a KNN classification algorithm to determine how well a movie did in relation to it's budget.
