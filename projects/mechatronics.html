            For my engineering experimentation course, my group was tasked with redesigning an educational plasma rig that performed carbon dioxide decomposition.
            Our client, Professor Kamau Wright, identified an issue with transferring treated carbon dioxide to the gas cell for analysis. 
            To address this issue, a piston mechanism was introduced.

            Another design constraint was that the outer acrylic chamber could not be damaged by drilling for inlet/outlet valves.
            In order to fulfill this, a new electrode holder had to be designed. 
            I designed the holders in CAD software and 3D printed the pieces to fit with given tolerances and offsets for plasma discharge to occur.
